<p>Hi, my name is Patrick Landers and I am a 3rd year Computer Engineering student at Rochester Institute of Technology. Here is a link to my <a href="Resume_v2.2.pdf">resume</a></p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Work</h3>

<p>Below is a list of projects that I have completed!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sleep Program - An applescript that puts the computer to sleep after a time input by the user. I wrote this with the purpose of learning more about prompts.</li>
  <li>Grade Book - A Python program that reads/writes data from/to files in order to plot grades using plotly. I originially wrote this to see how my grades were through the semester, but also learned how to plot data using plotly.</li>
  <li>Log Parser - A Python program that reads a log file in order to track data on a printer and its user. The use for this program is at my current job where my employer wanted to know how often the printer is being used and by which method (Print,Copy,Scan), along with data on each person that used the printer and what they did.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
